Typically, you’ll perform a certain exercise for a short period of time, followed by a brief break, before moving on to the next exercise. This process is repeated until you’ve gone through all of the exercises, and then you’ll finish off with a final exercise before moving on to the next section of the circuit.When it comes to circuit training, there are two main types of protocols that you can follow. The first type involves a fixed sequence of exercises, while the second involves a random sequence of exercises. With a fixed sequence, you will know exactly what exercises you will be doing at any given time. With a random sequence, you will not know what exercise you will be doing next. There are many benefits to both types of protocols, so it is up to you to decide which one you prefer.</p><h2>Why is circuit training so popular?</h2><p>The main reason why so many people love circuit training is because it is extremely versatile. You can choose to perform the same exercises in different ways, which means that you can mix things up every time you do a circuit. This allows you to keep progressing with your workout, even if you are not particularly interested in the specific exercises.Another reason why so many people love circuit training is because it is extremely effective.
