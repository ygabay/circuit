                                                    <p>When it comes to circuit training, keeping things challenging is one of the biggest challenges. There are so many different exercises that it can be hard to find something new each time you do it. That’s why we’ve put together this article with some helpful tips on how you can make circuit training more challenging.If you’ve been doing circuit training for a while, then you probably already know that it’s not as easy as it sounds. For example, if you’re running for 30 minutes straight, you might expect that you’ll burn around 350 calories. However, studies have shown that you’ll actually only burn around 200 calories from that same exercise. This is because your body will start adjusting to the demands of the exercise and will find new ways to conserve energy. That’s why it’s important to keep things challenging by changing up your workouts regularly and mixing up your exercises so that you don’t get bored (or worse, injured). Here are some helpful tips on how you can make circuit training more challenging…</p><h2>Add more variety to your exercises</h2><p>The first thing you can do is add more variety to your exercises. This will help to keep things fresh and prevent your body from getting used to a specific movement. If you’re doing a lot of running or cycling, for example, you can vary the distance you’re covering each time. If you’re doing a lot of weight training, you can vary the movements you’re doing instead. For example, you can change the way you’re holding the weight or the way you’re bringing it down to the floor. You can also add in some exercises that require a different skill set, like playing sports or using tools. This will help to keep things from getting boring and make your workouts more challenging.</p><h2>Change up your equipment</h2><p>If you’re using the same piece of equipment for each exercise, then you’re not really challenging yourself. This can make your workouts feel pretty repetitive and boring. You can make your workouts more challenging by changing up your equipment. You can do this by switching between different types of equipment or even using the same equipment in a different way.For example, you could use the same exercise bike or rowing machine but vary the resistance or change the way you’re holding on. You can also use the same dumbbell or kettlebell in different ways. For example, you could hold it in your hands for a press, in a squat rack for a squat, or in a kettlebell clean and press.</p><h2>Mix up your reps and sets</h2><p>Another way to make your workouts more challenging is to mix up your reps and sets. For example, you could do 20 reps of squats followed by 10 reps of burpees. This would be a challenging combination that would keep your body guessing. You could also do 20 reps of burpees followed by 10 reps of squats. This would be an equally challenging combination.Another way to mix up your reps and sets is to use a variety of rest periods. For example, you could do 20 squats followed by 10 burpees with only 10 seconds of rest in between. Or, you could do 20 burpees followed by 10 squats with only 10 seconds of rest between exercises.Mixing up your reps and sets will help to keep your workouts fresh and interesting. It also helps to prevent you from getting bored and might even improve your fitness as your body adjusts to the new demands placed on it.</p><h2>Mix up your exercises within the same type</h2><p>Another way to make your workouts more challenging is to mix up your exercises within the same type. For example, if you’re doing a circuit of squats and burpees, you could alternate between the two. This would make the circuit more challenging and would help to prevent your body from getting used to the same movement.You can also mix up your exercises within the same type by adding in an upper body exercise. For example, you could add in a push-up to your squats and burpees or a chin-up to your burpees and squats. Or, you could add in a core exercise like a plank or a side plank.Mixing up your exercises within the same type will help to keep your workouts interesting and prevent them from getting boring. It also makes it easier to track your progress.</p><h2>Add in some intervals</h2><p>Another way to make your workouts more challenging is to add in some intervals. Intervals are short periods of time where you’re doing a harder version of your exercise followed by a period of recovery. For example, you could do 20 squats followed by 10 burpees. Or, you could do 20 burpees followed by 10 squats.When you do an interval, you’re challenging your body to work at a higher intensity and to recover faster. This means that you’re burning more calories and working your muscles to a greater extent than if you were to do the same exercise for a longer period of time. This will help to make your workouts more challenging and to improve your fitness.</p><h2>Change up your rest periods</h2><p>Another way to make your workouts more challenging is to change up your rest periods. For example, you could do 20 squats followed by 10 burpees with only 10 seconds of rest between exercises. Or, you could do 20 burpees followed by 10 squats with only 10 seconds of rest between exercises.Changing up your rest periods will help to make your workouts more challenging and to prevent you from getting bored. It also makes it easier to track your progress because you can keep a record of your rest periods.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>When it comes to circuit training, keeping things challenging is one of the biggest challenges. There are so many different exercises that it can be hard to find something new each time you do it. That’s why we’ve put together this article with some helpful tips on how you can make circuit training more challenging.
